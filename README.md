# Rock Paper Scissors

The "optimal" strategy of RPS is to play random. This will result in equal
number of wins and losses. However, since many of the bots are sub-optimal,
perhaps it is possible to take advantage of that.

Can you make a bot that out-smarts the other bots, while at the same time
avoiding being out-smarted itself?

## Rules of the tournament
This program plays a round-robin tournament of Rock Paper Scissors between a
number of bots.

Each pair of bots plays a fixed number of games (currently 1000). The object
of the tournament is to achieve the highest total number of wins.
